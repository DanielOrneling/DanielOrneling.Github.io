This morning during the TechEd Europe 2013 keynote with Brad Anderson, Microsoft released several preview versions as promised. Windows Server 2012 R2 is one example and the System Center suite were also released. A preview version of Operations Manager 2012 R2 were also released and you can download it from TechnetÂ [here](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/evalcenter/dn205295?WT.mc_id=OO_Technet_Home_General_EN_US).

Some of the news in the 2012 R2 version of Operations Manager are the following;

- Monitoring Windows Services built on the .NET Framework
- Automatic discovery of ASP.NET MVC3 and MVC Applications
- Enabled APM of SharePoint 2010
- Integration with Team Foundation Server 2010 and 2012

I will dive deeper into the new version to see what it can do for us.

System Center 2012 R2 is expected to be generally available at the end of this year. It seems this year will be exciting as well.
