A lot has happened since my last blog post, and my motivation to write new blog posts has not really been on top. Due to the fact that my personal focus has not aligned with the company for some time now So that´s why I´m now being able to write this post about this new chapter in life.

#### The past

I´ve been doing SCOM for about 9 years now and it´s time for a change. I have retired from Approved after about 3 years. There I was working almost 100% of the time with SCOM. There was a lot of really nice projects, and it has been a great time there. But since my personal focus has been with Azure for quite some time now I needed a change. With this shifting personal focus I thought it was time to look around for new openings.

#### The future

As of today I am working for [AddPro](https://addpro.se/){:target="_blank"} as a Senior Consultant where I will focus on Azure Infrastructure instead. With the change of employer comes a change in the focus of this blog as I move on from SCOM. I will not write more about SCOM unless it´s directly connected to a subject I´m writing about of course.

#### Shifting focus of the blog

From now on I will publish Azure related articles here instead. I will share a lot of different things from how to get started using ARM templates to creating custom monitoring in Azure Monitor just to mention a few of the ideas I have.

I hope you stay with me on this journey and continue reading the blog. It goes without saying of course, but all the SCOM articles will remain intact on the blog as many of them still helps people on a daily basis.

If you have any comments or questions, feel free to drop a comment below and I´ll get back ASAP.
