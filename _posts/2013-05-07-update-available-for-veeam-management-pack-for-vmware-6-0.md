In my last post that you´ll find here, you could read about Veeams updated Management Pack for VMware.

What´s happened since they released the updated integration kit is that they released an update for it. What´s been updated in this new release?
<!--More-->
- Maintenance mode synchronization in System Center 2012 Operations Manager SP1
- VMGUEST to OpsMgr Agent relationship discovery

To update your own environment, download the updated Management Pack here and then just import the Management Pack in the SCOM console as you would do with any other Management Pack.

The full update description is to be found [here](http://www.veeam.com/kb1752){:target="_blank"}.
