It is now only 30 days until I fly out from Copenhagen to New York and then Chicago to attend Microsoft Ignite. Ignite is a new event which merges several different conferences like TechEd , Office 365 Summit and the Sharepoint conference(s) as well. The event takes place between May 4th and May 8th at McCormick Place in Chicago and there´s now 615 available sessions to attend (think you can attend them all?).

Yesterday, the opportunity to build your schedule was released and you can now browse all these sessions and add them to your schedule. Below I have listed the sessions to attend at Ignite that I´ve found so far concerning Operations Manager and Azure Operational Insights. You can check the schedule out at [MyIgnite](https://myignite.microsoft.com){:target="_blank"} where you need to login with the account you used when you registered for Ignite.
