Today it is just a week left until TechEd North America 2014 opens up in Houston, Texas when Brad Anderson delivers his keynote on stage in front of all the attendees. For those of us that registered for the pre-conference, the event will kick-start one day earlier on this coming Sunday with several tracks. I´m really looking forward to this event and i think it will be great.

It can be quite tricky to plan the sessions since there are so much to see. I will at least try to attend as many Operations Manager breakout sessions as I can so if you are interested in my blog, that´s where you´ll find me :) If you have not seen it yet, the OpsMgr team arranges a meet up on May 14th right after the event at the Hilton Americas hotel for those of us who wants to meet them and discuss the future.

If you´ve missed the course catalog, [check it out here](http://tena2014.eventpoint.com/topic/list){:target="_blank"} and make sure to plan your stay to make it a lot easier for yourself.

If you for some reason can´t attend, you can always follow the official TechEd hashtag #msteched on Twitter.

See you in Texas!
