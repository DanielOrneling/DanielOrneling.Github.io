Yesterday [Microsoft Ignite](https://ignite.microsoft.com) started with a big bang and during the keynote several cool things were shown, some for the first time and some that we´ve seen before. Sadly, I´m not at Ignite this year but I was able to stream the keynote from home instead.

One thing that got a lot of attention was the (OMS) Log Analytics where the VMware solution was shown among others (to be continued…) and the strength of the product was shown to the 22 000 attendees along with all of us that were watching remote. The other big thing is that both Windows Server 2016 and System Center 2016 was launched during the keynote and can now be downloaded as evaluation versions. The general availability will be in October as it seems right now so get ready, we´ve got a lot of cool things to dig into in the near future.

And at last, here´s the download locations for both [Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016) and [System Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-system-center-2016).

I´m pretty sure more things will be announced during the week so keep your eyes open for more posts in my blog.
