About 10 months ago i flew out to Houston, Texas to attend TechEd North America 2014. Now, I´ve been given the possibility to also attend this years event. This time, It´s called Microsoft Ignite and that´s a really big change since last year. TechEd is no more and instead of hosting multiple events, Microsoft have made a fusion of several events and is now hosting one big event instead. The past MS conferences of the fusion is:

- Microsoft Management Summit (last held in 2013)
- TechEd (last held in Barcelona in the fall of 2014)
- Sharepoint conference
- Lync conference
- Project conference

Looking at the calendar, it now says March 3 meaning it´s now only 61 days until May 4th (which is also [Star Wars Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day "May the fourth be with you")) and thousands of IT professionals are gathered in one place. This year, the event takes place in McCormick Place in Chicago. As usual, there are break-out sessions, labs, instructor led labs, reduced pricing on certifications and an expo hall available during the week.

I really think this will be an interesting year, not only because it´s a lot bigger than previous events but we´ve got a new generation of Windows Server and System Center coming in about a year. As Microsoft has hinted, there will be much more information about these new generations during the week.

The event kick-starts on the morning of May 4th with Satya Nadella´s keynote and then it´s just off for a great interesting week.
