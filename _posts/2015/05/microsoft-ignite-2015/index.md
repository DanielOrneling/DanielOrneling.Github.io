When i wrote my last post about Microsoft Ignite which you can [find here](http://blog.orneling.se/2015/04/sessions-to-attend-at-ignite/), the event were 30 days away. Now it's only 2 days away and I'm writing this post on the plane to Chicago (thank you SAS for WiFi in the air) somewhere over the atlantic ocean. If you're attending Ignite just as me, you hopefully already know most of what you need to know about the event. But for those of you that are not attending, what can we expect from Ignite?

Earlier years, Microsoft have arranged multiple events like Microsoft Management Summit (MMS), TechEd, Office 365 Summit etc. but this year is completely new. This year, Microsoft arranges a single big event where all of the above mentioned events are combined along with some SharePoint and Lync conferences as well. The event of the year is Microsoft Ignite and takes place in Chicago, IL during May 4th (Star Wars day) through to May 8th.

If youÂ´re like me really into SCOM and monitoring (or any other System Center components) you wouldnt wanna miss out on the System Center product team meet up which takes place this Tuesday between 4 PM and 5:30 PM. This is the place t be if you're into System Center so don't miss out on this great opportunity. Find out more and register for the meet up [here](http://blogs.technet.com/b/momteam/archive/2015/04/20/system-center-customer-product-team-meet-up-at-ignite-2015.aspx).

If you've followed me during the last year, you perhaps know that I've been blogging for Savision as well on both Live Maps Unity and Dashboards. Their booth #223 is a great place to find out more about the solutions.

If you happen to bump into me during the week, don't hesitate to introduce yourself as the networking part is one of the most valuable parts of the upcoming week. If you have any questions or just comments or any other thoughts, please leave acomment below. And at last if you're also attending Ignite, let's have an awesome week! :)
