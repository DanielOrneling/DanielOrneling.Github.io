So, finally TechEd North America 2014 has begun. This time, we´re in Houston, Texas (The lone star state) and the event goes on from today until this thursday. For some of us though, the event started yesterday with the pre-conference where ten sessions were delivered through out the day but the event didn´t officially start until today.

### The first day at TechEd

So what has happened today? For me, there was of course the keynote where Brad Anderson presented Microsofts visions about the future and shared some new possibillities in Azure among other things. You can watch the keynote here if you missed it. Besides from the keynote, the expo hall were also opened and we could meet with all the exhibitors and discuss there different solutions.

The rest of the day for myself consisted of different breakout sessions covering a lot of stuff from Azure and of course, to Operations Manager. My favorite session of today were the ”[DCIM-B329 Building Highly Effective Dashboards in Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Operations Manager](http://tena2014.eventpoint.com/topic/list)” where we could see the new widgets presented in SCOM 2012 R2 UR2 and 2012 SP1 UR6 in action. This was really a great session and even though i had seen the widgets before it was nice to see so many people taking in all this opportunities.

### What you can´t afford to miss

Tomorrow, there are no Operations Manager sessions at all but on wednesday, the OpsMgr product team arranges a meet up at the Hilton in the room 335.B. If you care about OpsMgr, this is a session you can´t afford to miss. At least I know i won´t miss it!
