Earlier this evening, SP1 for the System Center 2012 suite was released. It’s a massive release containing lots of updates for all of the products of the suite.

So far, everyone with a MSDN or TechNet subscription are able to download the updates, general availability will perhaps be in the beginning of January. I’ll get back with this information when it has been confirmed.
