Now that my blog has been up and running for a complete year, the time has come for a summary of the year 2015. Of course this statistic should be shared with my readers as well to let you know what we have accomplished together.
<!--More-->
During 2015 I wrote 41 different posts, starting with [Using your onprem AD account with Azure Operational Insights](http://blog.orneling.se/2015/01/using-your-onprem-ad-account-with-azure-operational-insights/){:target="_blank"} and ending the year with a post about [NiCE as a new sponsor](http://blog.orneling.se/2015/12/new-sponsor-nice/) and [A first look at SCOM 2016 Technical Preview 4](http://blog.orneling.se/2015/12/first-look-scom-2016-technical-preview-4/){:target="_blank"}. The complete year (from January 4 2015 to January 4 2016) ended at 24,863 views and 15,353 unique visitors.

The top ten posts with the most views is found below. Obviously a lot of you are curious for what SCOM 2016 has to offer as this covers two of the top three posts. As you can see, [A first look at the SCOM 2016 Technical Preview 2](http://blog.orneling.se/2015/05/a-first-look-at-the-scom-2016-technical-preview-2/){:target="_blank"} was the most popular post with 3,419 views.

The most popular day was December 11 with 291 views. This is also the day when I published [A first look at SCOM 2016 Technical Preview 4](http://blog.orneling.se/2015/12/first-look-scom-2016-technical-preview-4/) so I think this post will draw a lot more views during the start of 2016 as well.

During the year I also got to write a whitepaper along with [Savision](http://www.savision.com) about how you can make the most of System Center and Azure. This is a topic that is really hot right now with (almost) everybody discussing moving to the cloud in some way. In this whitepaper I´ve gone through how you can protect your investments in System Center and extend them by using Azure as well.  You can download your free copy of the whitepaper [here](https://www.savision.com/resources/white-paper/free-whitepaper-make-most-cloud-microsoft-system-center-azure).

I´m really looking forward to 2016 as I think it´ll be a great year, both for me personally but also for all of us with a lot of continued improvements in Azure and Operations Management Suite but also a new generation of System Center  with System Center 2016.
