My name is Daniel Örneling and I work as a senior consultant based in Sweden. My focus lies with Azure Infrastructure but with a little extra love for Azure Monitor and the different ways of automating things.
You will find lots of different solutions here, but my mindset is that if I will be doing something more than twice then it´s worth writing in code for a simpler, faster and more accurate deployment.

In this blog, you will find news and information covering Azure Monitor, Azure Automation, Azure in general, System Center Operations Manager and much more.  I started the blog somewhere back in 2012 as a way to share my knowledge with all of you out there, but also as a notebook for myself. I hope you will find the blog useful and keep your eyes open for recommendations and implementation guidelines. All of my posts are provided AS-IS with no warranties.

Feel free to reach out to me through e-mail if desired at Daniel AT Orneling.se
