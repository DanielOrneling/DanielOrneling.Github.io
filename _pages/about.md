My name is Daniel Ã–rneling and I work as a senior consultant at AddPro based in Sweden. My focus lies with Azure Infrastructure but with a little extra love for Azure Monitor and the different ways of automating things.

In this blog, you will find news and information covering Azure Monitor, Azure Automation, Azure in general, System Center Operations Manager and much more.  I started the blog somewhere back in 2012 as a way to share my knowledge with all of you out there, but also as a notebook for myself. I hope you will find the blog useful and keep your eyes open for recommendations and implementation guidelines. All of my posts are provided AS-IS with no warranties.

My Microsoft certifications are the following:

Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions
Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert: Private Cloud
Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure
Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate: Windows Server 2012
