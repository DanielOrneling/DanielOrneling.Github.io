Many of our customers are using Citrix XenApp to publish their applications and for that to work, you need XenServer, Provisioning Services etc. Do we want to monitor our Citrix environment? Of course! Can we? Of course! ComTrade is a company that’s partnered with Citrix and has now taken over all developing of Management Packs for Operations Manager since Citrix themselves stopped this.

Right now, there are MP’s available for XenServer, XenApp, Provisioning Services, Web interfaces and XenDesktop. All the above has been setup at a some customer sites and provides great monitoring. Read more about how to buy these and also implementing them [here](http://www.managementproducts.comtrade.com/management_pack/citrix/Pages/default.aspx).

### Netscaler MP

Yesterday I applied to ComTrades beta program for testing their upcoming Netscaler MP. Hopefully, I will be able to post a guide on how to implement the Netscaler MP soon on the blog.

Got any questions about the implementation? Leave a comment and I will get back as soon as possible.
